# HANDDETECTION-USING-OPENCV-MEDIAPIPE-PYTHON

WE WILL BE USING HAAR CASCADE (MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM) LIBRARY FOR ENCAPSULATING THE THE IMAGE AND CAMERA OR AN INPUT DEVICE

COMING TO THE INPUT OF IMAGE WE WILL BE DECRYPTING THE IMAGE OR INPUT GIVEN TO THE RUNNER BY NUMPY WHICH REARRANGES THE IMAGE OR INPUT WITH SIPLE ARRAY MATRIX 

FOR DETECTING THE HANDS IMPORTING OF HAND DETECTOR LIBRARY IS MUST AND SHOULD FROM OPEN CV LIBRARIES 

FOR FINDING THE DISTANCE BETWEEN TWO FINGERS WE WILL BE USING CONTROL BAR OPTION WHICH A MATH TOOL WHICH DEPLOYS THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWO FINGERS WHICH ARE GIVEN AS INPUT 

FOR THE DISPLAY OF TIME IMPORT TIME 


face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier('haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')
# Read the input image
#img = cv2.imread('test.png')
cap = cv2.VideoCapture('test.mp4')
